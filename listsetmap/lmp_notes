What lists, maps, and sets have in common is that they are all collections of values where all the values have the same type.

Lists are collections where those values are defined in a particular order and assigned numeric indices starting at zero, 
so we can say that each value is identified by a number.

Maps are collections where those values are not in a particular order but are each assigned a key string. 
We can therefore say that each value is identified by a string.

Sets are, similar to maps, collections where the values are in no particular order, 
but unlike maps the values are not assigned a key string. Instead, the values identify themselve

Notice that for the set, each value is identified by itself, not by either a number or a separate key string.

Thus the reason you can't index a set with a number is that its elements do not have numbers as their keys. 
Converting to a list with tolist assigns each of the elements a numeric index, and thus then count.index works 
to retrieve one of the elements.
